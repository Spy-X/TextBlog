A simple blog template system by Matt Finkel (mfinkel.net)

To use, put blog.php, template.html and .htaccess in a directory named "blog"

Blog posts are added by creating text files in the blog directory with the filename format YYYYMMDD.txt.  The first line in these files is the post title.  Each newline means a new paragraph.  Empty lines are ignored.

Website visitors view the blog post by entering a URL in the style www.website.com/blog/YYYYMMDD
